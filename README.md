# DagensLinux

[Check out a slideshow in swedish about piping and redirecting](https://shortlisted.github.io/dagenslinux/dagenslinux.html) in Linux.

HTML slides made with the excellent [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

Slides produced in frustrating [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), using the not so frustrating [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/).

Actual slides written using the very good [orgmode](http://orgmode.org/), exported to HTML with the help of very handy [ox-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal)

## Slides and all that
I'm supplying a friend with random Linux tips/suggestions/commands, and the more indepth areas were hard to cover in just texts, so I put them here instead.

All inspiration for actually doing all this in this specific way came from [ransjo](https://github.com/ransjo/). Thanks!
